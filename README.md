## LRDNN: Local-refining based Deep Neural Network for Person Re-Identification with Attribute Discerning

* **Introduction**: This repository contains the LRDNN implementation of paper LRDNN: Local-refining based Deep Neural Network for Person Re-Identification with Attribute Discerning.

* **Abstract**: Recently, pose or attribute information has been widely used to solve person re-identification (re-
ID) problem. However, the inaccurate output from pose or attribute modules will impair the final person re-ID performance. Since re-ID, pose estimation and attribute recognition are all based on the person appearance information, we propose a Local-refining based Deep Neural Network (LRDNN) to aggregate pose estimation and attribute recognition to improve the re-ID performance. To this end, we add a pose branch to extract the local spatial information and optimize the whole network on both person identity and attribute objectives. To diminish the negative affect from unstable pose estimation, a novel structure called channel parse block (CPB) is introduced to learn weights on different feature channels in pose branch. Then two branches are combined with compact bilinear pooling. Experimental results on Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reid datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
